# PhishDetect: Phishing URL Detection with Machine Learning

PhishDetect is an open-source cybersecurity project aimed at detecting phishing URLs using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. Phishing attacks continue to pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations worldwide, making it crucial to have effective tools for identifying and mitigating these risks. PhishDetect provides a robust solution by leveraging machine learning algorithms to accurately differentiate between malicious and legitimate URLs.

## Features

### Machine Learning Approach

PhishDetect employs a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to detect phishing URLs:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather a diverse dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs and preprocess the data for analysis.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from URLs, including IP address presence, URL length, domain age, URL shortening usage, web traffic analysis, iframe detection, status bar manipulation, and right-click disable detection.

- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using various algorithms, such as KNeighbors, DecisionTree, RandomForest, NeuralNetwork, and XGBoost, and select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance through cross-validation and testing on unseen data to ensure reliable phishing detection.

### Cybersecurity Features

PhishDetect incorporates several cybersecurity features to enhance phishing URL detection:

- **IP Address Detection**: Identifies URLs containing IP addresses, a common tactic used by phishers to deceive users.

- **URL Length Analysis**: Flags excessively long URLs, often associated with phishing attempts.

- **Domain Age Analysis**: Utilizes WHOIS data to determine domain age, helping identify newly registered domains commonly used in phishing attacks.

- **URL Shortening Detection**: Detects the use of URL shortening services, which are frequently employed to disguise malicious links.

- **Web Traffic Analysis**: Analyzes web traffic patterns to identify suspicious domains with low or no traffic, indicative of phishing websites.

- **Iframe Detection**: Detects invisible iframes, a technique used by phishers to overlay content and deceive users.

- **Status Bar Manipulation Detection**: Identifies attempts to manipulate the status bar to display fake URLs and deceive users.

- **Right-Click Disable Detection**: Detects attempts to disable right-click functionality, commonly done to prevent users from viewing source code and inspecting URLs.

## Usage

To use PhishDetect, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the documentation. You can input URLs for real-time phishing detection and leverage the power of machine learning to safeguard against phishing attacks.
